This application was created by Mitchell Carroll for General Assembly's WDI14 program(DC campus). This was created for the final project. The app is a HackerNews clone (https://news.ycombinator.com/) and uses their API to pull the data that is displayed.

Technologies used for this application are HTML, CSS, Javascript, and ReactJS. I also ran test in Jest and Enzyme.
